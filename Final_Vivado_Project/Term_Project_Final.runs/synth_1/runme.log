Reason is one or more of the following :
	1: RAM has multiple writes via different ports in same process. If RAM inferencing intended, write to one port per process. 
	2: Unable to determine number of words or word size in RAM. 
	3: No valid read/write found for RAM.

INFO: [Project 1-236] Implementation specific constraints were found while reading constraint file [C:/Users/bahar/Term_Project_Final/Term_Project_Final/Term_Project_Final.srcs/constrs_1/imports/EE446/Nexys-A7-100T-Master.xdc]. These constraints will be ignored for synthesis but will be used in implementation. Impacted constraints are listed in the file [.Xil/Project_top_module_propImpl.xdc].
Resolution: To avoid this warning, move constraints listed in [.Xil/Project_top_module_propImpl.xdc] to another XDC file and exclude this new file from synthesis with the used_in_synthesis property (File Properties dialog in GUI) and re-run elaboration/synthesis.
